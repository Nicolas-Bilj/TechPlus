# Midterm Exam Project

This is our project submission for the midterm exam. We have decided to adapt the Python program by integrating the Flask library to provide a user interface different from a terminal.
All our work is located in the '**midterm**' folder.

On this website, you can:
- Get information between two cities, similar to the original program.
- Find a city even if you don't have its full name and retrieve its information.

### Prerequisites
It is important to have Python 3 installed on your machine.

### Launching the Program

#### On Linux:
```bash
./start.sh
```
#### On Windows:
Run '**start.bat**'
